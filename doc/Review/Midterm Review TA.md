**IMPORTANT: The coach had to leave before we were able to fill in the rubric. Therefore, this is just my rubric. The coach will fill it in later when he has time, and send it to the group and me. I'll upload his rubric to the gitlab later.**

### Feedback on group performance regarding the product

Testing is still lacking, but since they are making a front-end tool, it is understandable. They already said they will focus on testing soon. They do have a pipeline for it already, which for now only builds and runs a dummy test.

The other lower point is documentation. They have good code comments, but no readme/wiki. This is a important point to the client, since they plan on adapting things later.

Design quality is excellent, they're paying a lot of attention to make sure the code is modular and extendable.

### Feedback on group performance regarding the process

Excellent work, they communicate very well and stick to their project plan. The group is very independent.

### Elaboration on grading criteria marked *Insufficient*

| If the group doesn't swiftly improve their workflow and/or product they are in immediate danger of failing the software project. | The workflow and product of the group are acceptable so far. However there are some issues. The group should be careful to not let this get worse, and focus on improving. | The workflow and product of the group are looking good so far, and the project team and has a good chance of passing software project if they continue like this. |
