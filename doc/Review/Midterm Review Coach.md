### Feedback on group performance regarding the product

Overall the group seems well on way to implement a GUI for data exploration, and the client is happy with it.

### Feedback on group performance regarding the process

Overall the group seems to collaborate in reasonably effective way. 
Communication with the advisor could be a bit better.
I did not receive this rubric until after the midterm meeting, and hence it was not really possible for me to ask about all the above criteria, but I think these aspects are in order.
